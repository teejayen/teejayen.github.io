# Dark Web Monitoring

Dark Web Monitoring focuses on cyber threats that are specific to our clients’ environments. answers IT has partnered with with Dark Web ID to monitor the Dark Web and the criminal hacker underground for exposure of our clients’ credentials to malicious individuals. Our service is designed to help our customers detect and mitigate cyber threats that leverage stolen email addresses and passwords.

We accomplish this by looking specifically for our clients’ top level email domains. When a credential is identified, we harvest it and let you know, so you can take immediate action to protect your accounts. While we harvest data from typical sites like Pastebin, a lot of our data originates from sites that require credibility or a membership within the hacker community to enter. To that end, we monitor over 500 distinct Internet relay chatroom (IRC) channels, 600,000 private Websites, 600 twitter feeds, and execute 10,000 refined queries daily.

## answers IT Dark Web Monitoring
The Dark Web is a hidden universe contained within the “Deep Web” – a sub-layer of the Internet that is hidden from conventional search engines. Search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo only search .04% of the indexed or “surface” Internet. The other 99.96% of the Web consists of databases, private academic and government networks, and the Dark Web. The Dark Web is estimated at 550 times larger than the surface Web and growing. Because you can operate anonymously, the Dark Web holds a wealth of stolen data and illegal activity.

Dark Web Monitoring protects your business by delivering the same advanced credential monitoring capabilities used by Fortune 500 companies to companies of your size. We connect to multiple Dark Web services including Tor, I2P and Freenet, to search for compromised credentials, without requiring you to connect any of your software or hardware to these high-risk services directly. This allows us to provide a proactive solution with real-time awareness of compromised credentials before identity theft or data breaches occur.

## Why we think it’s important
– Compromised credentials are used to conduct further criminal activity, such as data breaches of sensitive corporate information, as well as identity theft of individual employees.

– Users often have the same password for multiple services, such as network logon, social media, online stores and other services, exponentially increasing the potential damage from a single compromised username and password.

– Today, you have limited visibility into when your credentials are stolen; over 75% compromised credentials are reported to the victim organization by a third party, such as law enforcement.
