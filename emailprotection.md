Email is one of the most commonly used methods of attack against businesses. Spam – unsolicited emails sent in mass quantities – can cause serious problems beyond annoyance. Email is commonly used for phishing, to maliciously obtain sensitive information, including credit card numbers, passwords, usernames, and other personal and company information.

When it comes to protection, layering multiple complimentary solutions is the best approach.

## Spam Filtering

Spam filtering detects unsolicited and unwanted email and prevents those messages from getting to a user's inbox. Spam filters look for certain signatures in emails to determine the likelihood of the incoming email being spam.

## Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)

Legacy, signature-based intelligence feeds can’t evolve quickly enough to stop today’s email-borne attacks. Advanced Threat Protection safeguards your business against sophisticated malicious threats posed by email messages by using advanced technology such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and sandboxing. When choosing an Advanced Threat Protection solution, it's important to ensure it provides options such as:

**Attachment Scanning**  to check email attachments for malicious content.

**Link / URL Scanning** to verify URLs in email messages and attachments to ensure they are not malicious.

**Anti-phishing Protection** to detect attempts to impersonate users, and email domains.

**Reporting and tracking capabilities** to analyse who is being targeted and what sort of attack vectors are being used. It also allows us to determine who has clicked on unsafe links, leading to conversations and training about remaining vigilant.

## Email Encryption

Email encryption is used to protect the content from being read by entities other than the intended recipients. Encryption can either be set on the transport layer, or can be enabled per email. Encryption can be also be used to help prevent sensitive information from being printed, forwarded, or copied by unauthorised people.

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Data Loss Prevention protects your business from accidental sharing as well as intentional or malicious actions by stopping emails from being sent which contains information such as tax file numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, driver's licence numbers and other personally identifiable information. DLP needs to be properly implemented, and requires constant monitoring and tweaking to ensure it meets security policies.

## Humans are layers, too!

Even with the all of the above solutions in place, there’s one final layer that needs to be considered: you! When reading emails, the first things that are likely to get our attention is the sender’s name, email, and subject. It may come as a surprise that spoofing these is an easy thing to do.

Arming your employees with the know-how to avoid risky behaviors can make a substantial impact on your business' ability to reduce risks associated with email. Email security best practices for end users/employees include:

- Never opening attachments or clicking on links in email messages from unknown senders.

- Engaging employees in ongoing security awareness training around email security risks, and how to avoid falling victim to phishing attacks over email.

- Never sharing passwords with anyone, including co-workers.

- Trying to send as little sensitive information as possible via email, and sending sensitive information only to recipients who require it.

- Avoiding access to company email from public WiFi connections.

Even if you know the source of the email, if something looks suspicious, report it to answers IT - we would much rather take a quick call and give you the “all OK”, avoiding hours upon hours of trying to recover from a potential breach.
