Reading to children helps develop early literacy by building vocabulary, and nurturing a love of books, language, and reading. I read about the [1000 Books Before Kindergarten](https://1000booksbeforekindergarten.org/) initiative, and I'm aiming to do this for both A & T. Just 1 book a night (3 or 4 seems more commonplace in our household), will add up to about 365 books in a year, so 1000 books will take under three years! The same book or story can be read multiple times and it counts towards the 1000 also (which is great, because A really likes Old MacDonald!).

I've started logging books from 2018-06-15 onwards as we read (and re-read) to work out just how many we get through.
