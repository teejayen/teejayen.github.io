I've run two brainstorming sessions recently, and decided to take a different approach. Rather than a shouting match, where the loudest voice becomes the consensus, and a scribe who can barely keep up - they were *silent*.

- 10 minutes to brainstorm - individually and silently
- 15 minutes to review and discuss ideas as a team
- 5 minutes to vote on the most important ideas

Yellow Post-it notes for each idea, and then a Red Post-it note for any crazy out there ideas. The Post-it notes were easy to group together into broad categories, easy to move from the meeting room to my desk, and can then be used as tasks on a KanBan board to track implementation status.
