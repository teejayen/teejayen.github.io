Microsoft have [recently announced](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2019/01/02/myanalytics-the-fitness-tracker-for-work-is-now-more-broadly-available/) that MyAnalytics will now be included for everyone using Microsoft 365 and Office 365 Enterprise and Business suites that include mailboxes.

The update also includes additional signals to track Microsoft Teams calls and chats, as well as signals from documents authored in OneDrive and SharePoint. We've gone all in with Microsoft, and moved all internal communications and our phone calls (using [SwitchConnect Teams Direct Routing](https://www.switchconnect.com.au/our-solutions/unified-communications/teams-direct-routing/)) to Microsoft Teams so this announcement will definitely increase it's effectiveness.

Touted as the "fitness tracker for work", I'm looking forward to the insights that MyAnalytics will provide in to how I am spending my time each day, and using the data to modify my habits and increase my productivity.
