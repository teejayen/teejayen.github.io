>“Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.”

\-- C.G. Jung

In my seemingly never ending procrastination I have found myself stuck in a cycle of introspection. This lead to taking personality tests to better understand what makes me tick. It came as no surprise to discover that I am an INTP according to the [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator), and a Type 5 according to the [Enneagram of Personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality).

Introspection has totally taken over my thoughts, and time - almost to the point of the degradation of other interests and responsibilities. Rather than remaining *stuck in my head* I've started to write a journal to unload my fleeting thoughts and ideas and quiet the mind, albeit temporarily. The transfer of my thoughts onto paper is a symbolic release in and of itself.
