It's been quite a while since I last wrote a post, I've had plenty of ideas but haven't been able to make the time to write them due to other going ons.

Trying to be more diligent in putting together [Book Notes](/books) each time I finish a book - knowing that my summary is just a click away definitely helps ingrain the knowledge.

We're reading [lots of books to the kids](/kidsbooks) - we've also joined the library and they have a HUGE selection that will help us get to 1000 and beyond...

[Journaling](/2018/06/14/introspection/) is definitely helping with organising my thoughts, and it's something I look forward to each night - hard to believe it's been a month since I started. It's also led to other interests in quality stationery and fountain pens, even though my writing is atrocious.. something else to work on, I suppose.
