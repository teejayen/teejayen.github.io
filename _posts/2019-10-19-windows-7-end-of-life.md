Just under 3 months away, on January 14, 2020, Microsoft will no longer be releasing new updates or security patches for either Windows 7 (or Windows Server 2008). That doesn’t mean Windows 7 systems will stop working, but it does mean they will quickly become highly vulnerable to cyber attacks that could put your business at risk.

Moving to Windows 10 has several benefits, including:

- Significantly faster start-up/boot times
- Increased IT security and management capabilities
- Access to state-of-the-art technology
- Increased efficiency
- Improved and extended hardware support

Since the free transition from Windows 7 to Windows 10 has long since expired, there are a two upgrade paths we recommend:

Our strong recommendation is moving to a new computer. This ensures that you have the latest features, and will also provide enhanced security and performance. Computers that are running Windows 7 are probably several years old, outside of warranty, and are due for replacement. With the new hardware you will also get the new version of the Windows operating system Windows 10.

Migrating Windows 7 computers to Windows 10 is a cost-effective option, however it may not be available for all computers. Companies can do an “in-place upgrade” for their desktops and laptops as most computers running Windows 7 can run Windows 10. An outline of all possible upgrade paths from Windows 7 is published at [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/windows-10-upgrade-paths).

Pricing for a Windows 10 Pro license starts at around $400 upfront, or if you are using Office 365 upgrading to the [Microsoft 365 Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-business-service-description) subscription will provide upgrade rights to Windows 10 Business along with a plethora of other features.

For the sake of completeness, Microsoft is offering Extended Security Updates (ESUs) - but it will cost you! The main reason to look in to Extended Security Updates would be for legacy application that won’t run on Windows 10. This is available on a per-device basis until January 2023 and is only available if you are running Windows 7 Enterprise. In the first year, January 2020 to January 2021, Windows 7 Enterprise updates will cost approximately $40 per device, in the second year, $75 per device, and in the third year $150 per device.

Your business should be taking advantage of the latest software solutions in order to increase productivity and efficiency.
