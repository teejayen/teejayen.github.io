Wake up, medicate, caffeinate, then rush to the office - sound familiar? Well that's how my mornings used to go - no routine, no planning for the day, just the bare minimum. But that all changed after reading [The Miracle Morning](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B013PKZUOW) by Hal Elrod.

The foundations of the book are Hal's Life S.A.V.E.R.S, which are the six parts of the routine â€” silence, affirmations, visualisation, exercise, reading and scribing. I try following most of these parts, but have slightly tweaked it based on personal preferences - here's how my morning now looks:

- Wake up at around 0527, most of the time I get out of bed on the first alarm but there is another at 0534 just in case!
- Two glasses of iced water, then a glass of sole  with lemon juice
- Around twenty minutes of meditation (I started off using Headspace, but have switched to using the [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/) app)
- Some basic stretches / yoga poses (Downward Dog, Cobra Pose, Bridge Pose, Child's Pose, and finally Supine Twist)
- Make a cup of Rooibos tea ([Aldi has it cheap](https://www.aldi.com.au/en/groceries/just-organic/chocolate-detail/ps/p/just-organic-fairtrade-rooibos-herbal-infusion-tea/), and it's just as good if not better than T2)
- Read through the daily devotion from [The Daily Stoic](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B01KAFIQE6) by Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman
- Write down 3 things I'm grateful in my journal
- Spend about 20-30 minutes reading (generally self help / business books)
- Ice cold shower

My new morning routine sets my day up for success - it has me feeling energised, focussed and ready to tackle anything that comes my day! There have been a couple of mornings where I have slept through the alarm (oops!) - but I figure it's my body telling me I need more sleep. In these cases I've found that at a minimum I need to meditate, read and have my ice cold shower or my day just doesn't feel right.

I'd like to eventually wake up earlier (around 0445) and add in a brisk walk, but getting enough sleep has been difficult lately with a teething 16 month old - hopefully once T is in to a better sleep routine I'll be able to get to bed earlier, and a better nights sleep.

I'll set out to write posts on each part of the routine in due course, and provide greater detail on where I have seen recommendations or the science behind each step.
