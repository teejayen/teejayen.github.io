Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, is a security protocol that uses modern encryption to send and receive sensitive information all over the internet. SSL makes sure that every packet of data exchanged between the user’s browser and an SSL-enabled website is protected by state-of-the-art encryption techniques. If you have a website, you need SSL. It’s as simple as that.

Recently, as a part of an initiative to make the web a safer place, popular web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox have started marking HTTP-only websites as insecure if they contained any text inputs such as login forms or credit card data fields. So we've done our part too - if you host your website with answers IT we've enabled free SSL certificates provided by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority run by the non-profit Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), which has a lot of big name sponsors behind them including Cisco, Facebook, Mozilla, and Shopify.

To make full use of the free certificate you'll need to redirect all traffic from HTTP to HTTPS, using a plugin like Really Simple SSL for WordPress. If that all sounds too difficult, just get us involved - simply email through to ssl@answersit.com.au and someone from our Website Solutions Team will be in touch.
