I've started collating my [book notes](https://neilen.com.au/books/), primarily for personal reference.

Most of my reading is digital (Kindle), and I use Kindle Mate to export the highlights, as such these may not have page numbers that correspond with the printed book.

I previously listened to quite a lot of audiobooks (Audible) when commuting to work via car (I ride a motorbike now, so concentration is a must!). I generally didn't make detailed notes of these - however the majority are on my list to read again in due course, so notes will follow.

My late grandfather has a library of books I've also started exploring - these have lots of his personal notes in them already, so I may transcribe my own with varying levels of completeness.

I'm always open to book suggestions, so please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/teejayen/teejayen.github.io/pulls) to add to my list.
