At PKCG we see a lot of businesses using Office 365 Business Premium. Office 365 Business Premium is a best-in-class productivity solution that gives you the apps and services that will help your employees get more done and work better together. Is it the best solution for your business though?
We like to think of Office 365 Business Premium as a starting point that puts you on a path to Microsoft 365 Business which will help you address more advanced security and compliance requirements.

Microsoft 365 Business includes everything that Office 365 Business Premium offers while adding Advanced Security and Device Management features to protect your company data across personal and company-owned devices.
Some of the Advanced Security Features offered as part of Microsoft 365 Business include:

- Protection from unsafe attachments, suspicious links, attachment checking and scanning to protect your business from malware
- Information Protection Policies to help control and manage how data is accessed
- Controls to protect company data on personal mobile devices
- Preservation, compliance and archiving capabilities

Device Management is another feature that is not available on Office 365 Business Premium. Microsoft 365 Business includes an upgrade to Windows 10 Business from Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. There are also simplified controls to easily manage Windows 10 Pro PCs, self-service PC deployment with Windows AutoPilot and secure management for iOS, Android, Windows and macOS devices.

At PKCG, we can help your business navigate through the many options of Office 365, and Microsoft 365.
