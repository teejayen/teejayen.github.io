title:  ".au TLD temporarily suspended on Amazon Web Services Route 53"

I was unable to find _any_ information online about .com.au TLD domains no longer being an option for registration or transfer in Route 53... turns out that Amazon have temporarily suspended registrations and transfers of .au TLD domains due to the new policy changes.

After logging a case with AWS Support, they cannot provide any ETA for when it will be available again.
