title:  "chrome.exe high CPU usage"
date:   2019-04-02

One of my client's at answers IT has an RDS (Remote Desktop Server) which runs a few line of business applications, for the most part it had been running fine but over the last 6 months they have noticed it getting slower over time and the (band-aid) fix has been to restart it, it then runs fine for upwards of 2 weeks until it starts getting sluggish again!

I've been monitoring the server to determine what was causing the high CPU usage and chrome.exe was constantly rearing it's head, specifically the software_reporter_tool.exe. Fortunately, it can easily be disabled through a few registry changes:


```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome]
"ChromeCleanupEnabled"=dword:00000000
"ChromeCleanupReportingEnabled"=dword:00000000
```

The Chromium Project provides [an exhaustive list of policies](https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#ChromeCleanupEnabled) which can be set, they do require that the computer / server is joined to an Active Directory domain however.
