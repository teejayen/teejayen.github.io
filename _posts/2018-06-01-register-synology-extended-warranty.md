Registering the Extended Warranty for Synology devices isn't as straight forward as the three steps they provide. So I knocked up a quick procedure to share with our post-sales team to assist.

1. Log in to the [Synology Account](https://account.synology.com/).
2. Navigate to *My Devices* and find the NAS which has had the extended warranty purchased, click on the three dots and select *Register Extended Warranty*.

3. Enter in the license key from the physical card.

4. Confirm the details to ensure that the extended warranty is the correct length term.

5. A final confirmation will then show, and this completes the registration process.
