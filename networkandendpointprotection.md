# Network and Endpoint Protection

The number of cyber attacks are at an all-time high with no signs of slowing down. To make matters worse, cyber criminals are focusing on small to midsize businesses, as they see you as easy targets compared to large organisations with dedicated IT security teams. They are launching dynamic, stealth threats that are targeted and designed to infiltrate defenses through multiple entry points of a network.

answers IT offers a full suite of managed security solutions that prevent, detect and respond to the most sophisticated types of threats. Simple endpoint anti-virus is no longer enough, instead we take a layered approach using best of breed solutions to provide your business the protection it needs!

Our layered protection starts with **DNS and Web Filtering** which automatically denies users access to known malicious sites, but also enables URL filtering that can block risky and inappropriate sites that may harbor malware.

We then use **Network Based Anti-Malware** at the gateway to block known threats including viruses, trojans, spyware and ransomware in real time. This uses a combination of signatures, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and algorithmic science to defend against continuously evolving malware.

Our **Endpoint Protection** uses an Advanced Threat Intelligence platform which captures, analyses and classifies information across millions of website addresses, IP addresses, files, and mobile apps using machine learning and contextual analysis. This enables our Endpoint Protection to accurately predict how likely something is to be malicious in the future by it's associations. For example, a seemingly benign address, which other services may classify as safe, may be tied to other networks with histories of dangerous behavior.

Technology vendors are also doing their part to ensure vulnerabilities are fixed as quickly as possible, usually releasing an update within hours of learning about new malware. Our protection also includes **Patch Management**, not just for the operating system but also most third party applications you have installed. Our platform is fully automated and policy-based, and ensures everything on your network is kept up to date.

Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) are a stealthy attack in which a threat actor gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period of time. We use a unique approach to monitor for APT, leveraging Global Threat Intelligence Networks to scan traffic metadata and payloads for variants of known threats, and AI (artificial intelligence) to detect anomalies in network traffic, protocols and behaviour.

Our Threat Detection & Response solution is a powerful collection of advanced malware defense tools that correlate threat indicators from endpoints and the network firewall to stop known, unknown and evasive malware threats. A key feature of TDR is Host Containment which will isolate endpoints from the network and prevent any further infection, and once we have cleaned up the malware only then will the device be able to connect back - stopping worms and ransomware in their tracks!

Even with all these layers in place, there is no silver bullet to cybersecurity and protection. Taking a layered approach to your protection however will significantly reduce the risk of an malware infection occurring. Focus on what you do best, and let us take care of all your protection needs without disrupting day-to-day business operations â€“ providing you with peace of mind.
