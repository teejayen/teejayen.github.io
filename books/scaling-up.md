Verne certaintly articulated himself well when he said "it's a bit like drinking from a firehose!" Not exactly a leisurely read but instead a well organised and actionable reference book.

Scaling Up definitely a book I will keep coming back to, and it's on the "to read" list again for 2018.

[answers IT](https://answersit.com.au) engaged with a Gazelles Coach in 2016 after our CEO first read Scaling Up and we've definitely seen a huge increase in growth since then (going from about 4 staff to 17 as of 2018-06,with the revenue to support it).  Gazelles focus on improving “people, strategy, execution and cash.”

At our most recent "quarterly stategic planning meeting" in late March we were very fortunate to have [Keith Cupp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gazelles/), CEO of Gazelles International, sit in and provide his thoughts and feedback. 

Much of the underlying content for Scaling Up draws from ideas from authors such as Brad Smart, Jim Collins, and Patrick Lencioni.

Not many highlights follow as I listened to the audiobook on Audible.

## My Highlights and Notes

>The best leaders have the right questions, but turn to their employees, customers, advisors, and the crowd to mine the answers.

>Establish a handful of rules, repeat yourself a lot, and act consistently with those rules. This is the role and power of Core Values. If discovered and used effectively, these values guide all the relationship decisions and systems in the company.

>Set a handful of Priorities (the fewer the better); gather quantitative and qualitative Data daily and review weekly to guide decisions; and establish an effective daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual meeting Rhythm to keep everyone in the loop. Those who pulse faster, grow faster.

>“Routine sets you free” is a key driving principle behind our methodologies and tools.

>To get to 10 employees, founders must delegate activities in which they are weak. To get to 50 employees, they have to delegate functions in which they are strong!

>“If more than one person is accountable, then no one is accountable.”

>5. Hire fewer people, but pay them more. 4. Give recognition, and show appreciation. 3. Set clear expectations, and give employees a clear line of sight. 2. Don’t demotivate; “dehassle.” 1. Help people play to their strengths.

>The only way to grow a company is to grow the people first.

>challenge the team member who reports, “Everything is fine!”
