>Minimalism is about intentionality. It is marked by clarity, purpose, and thoughtfulness. At its core, minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of everything that distracts us from it.


>Minimalism slows down life and frees us from this modern hysteria to live faster. It finds freedom to disengage. It seeks to remove the frivolous and keep the significant.

>Owning fewer possessions provides the perfect roadmap for living the life we’ve always dreamed of living.

>Minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of everything that distracts from it. It is a highly personal journey that forces us to identify and articulate our highest values.

>Embracing a life content with fewer possessions has modeled for them the important truths that personal belongings are not the key to happiness, that security is found in their character, and that the pursuit of happiness runs a different road than the pursuit of possessions.

>Reduce your expenses by choosing a more minimalist life. Learn to live with less. Living with less frees up your life to invest into others. And living with reduced expenses allows you the freedom to spend less time at the office and more resources on others.

>Minimalism is always going to look different from person to person and family to family. Our passions are different. Our personalities are different. Our pasts are different. Our presents are different. As a result, the essentials of our lives are going to change.

>Clutter is a) too much stuff in too small a space; b) anything you no longer use or love; or c) anything that leads to a feeling of disorganization.

>If you still do not feel fully capable of removing the excess possessions from your home, find encouragement in an intermediate step. For example, put the items you can’t quite part with in a cardboard box out of sight with a date on it.

>Realize your purchases cost far more than the price on the sticker. Each one will also require time, energy, and effort once they enter your home. Before making a purchase, begin asking yourself some tough questions. Is this item really needed? Do I have a place to store it? How much extra work will this possession add to my life? Am I buying it for the right reasons?

>Relationships with others are always more exciting and fulfilling than possessions.

>Wear clothing for its usefulness rather than as an attempt to impress others.

>Don’t look towards ”things” to soothe the pain we encounter in life. Instead, seek love, acceptance, and security.

>Too many toys in a box only get in the way of the good ones. A funny thing happens after holidays. A mountain of new toys enter our children’s lives. The toys are initially met with incredible excitement. However, after two or three days, they are pushed to the side as our kids return to the tried-and-true toys they had been playing with long before the holiday ever occurred. The new toys we thought would make them happier, don’t. Instead, they just start to get in the way.

>The more possessions we own, the more of our time is required to care for them.

>Turn off the television. Go outside. Live life, don’t just watch it.

>Replace “Do I want this?” with “Do I need this?” And help your son or daughter ask the same question. It’s one of the most important lessons they will ever learn.

>Many parents believe that more toys will result in less fighting because there are more options available. However, the opposite is true far too often. Siblings argue about toys. Every time we introduce a new toy into the relationship, we give them another reason to establish their “territory” among the others. On the other hand, siblings with fewer toys are forced to share, collaborate, and work together.

>Since deciding to live with less, I have less clutter in my home, less stress in my life, more time for my family, more generosity in my spending, more energy for my passions, more contentment in my heart, more gratitude in my soul, and far more opportunity to pursue things of greater worth.

>Consider the full cost of your purchases. Usually when we purchase an item, we only look at the sticker price. But this is rarely the full cost. Our purchases always cost us additional time, energy, and focus (cleaning, organizing, maintaining, fixing, replacing, or removing). Making a habit of intentionally factoring those expenses into our purchases will allow our minds to make more competent and confident decisions about our consumption habits.

>To exist is to consume. But we were designed to accomplish things far greater. And the sooner we remove ourselves from overconsumption, the sooner we realize our truest potential.

>Make it a habit to enforce a 30-day wait period on major purchases. The extra month will provide ample opportunity to answer the question, “Do I really need this?” It will also help you answer these questions: “Are there any subconscious motives to this purchase?,” “Which brand is the highest quality?,” “Can I find it cheaper elsewhere?,” and “How likely is it this purchase will soon become unused?”

>Find common ground. Likely, there are some commonly used areas in your home that you can both agree need some decluttering. Whether it be a junk drawer, a linen closet, the kitchen counters, or the garage, even the worst of hoarders can typically come to the rational conclusion that something can be better organized (no matter how small the area).

>“Decide now to live off one income, even if both of you are working. Put the entire second income directly into savings.”

>Next time you find yourself comparing yourself to others, get up and change your surroundings. Go for a walk—even if only to the other side of the room. Allow the change in your surroundings to prompt change in your thinking.
