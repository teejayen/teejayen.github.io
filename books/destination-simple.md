Simple, short, and to the point - I picked up this book for free from Kindle Unlimited and finished it in an hour, with time to spare.

A strong focus on mindfulness by turning daily tasks into rituals to create a calmer, happier, and more intentional life.

## My Highlights and Notes
> If you change the flow of your days - making them a little simpler, lighter and easier - the physical decluttering will follow.

>by being intentional with your daily actions you can create the simpler, happier life you want. And you can do this by harnessing the power of rituals and rhythms.

>The true secret of happiness lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life.

>We have forgotten how to simply be. How to immerse ourselves in what is in front of us. How to truly engage in face-to-face conversation, personal connections and true downtime. And we are burning out, completely addicted to this digital connection.

>Whatever you choose to do while you unplug, the important thing is that you connect with the real world, or allow your mind to access a different virtual one – the world of your own imagination.

>Rhythm moves you. You want to dance to rhythm, find your groove, let go a little, enjoy the moment and see where it takes you.

>Tilting allows us to focus on what’s important in the moment, and intentionally choose to put our energies into those areas. The physical act of tilting means we’re leaning in to one thing, and leaning out of another.
