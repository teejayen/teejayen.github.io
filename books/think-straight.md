Short, succinct, and to the point - hopefully how my thoughts will become after reading THINK STRAIGHT by Darius Foroux. 

## My Highlights and Notes
>When we sit down and observe our thoughts for a few minutes, we will notice that a lot of things flow through our mind. The thoughts are just “there.” Nothing we can change about that. But since we have free will, we can decide which thoughts we focus on. Hence, we can influence the direction of consciousness.

>The emphasis is on deciding. And that’s what this book is about: With practice, you can get better at controlling your thoughts, so you can decide what you think.

>You have the ability to decide what you think. And since the result of your life depends on your thoughts, I think it’s the most important thing in life. When we improve the way we think, nothing is impossible to achieve. That simple realization changes everything. Many great thinkers have written about the importance of thoughts. But William James’ godfather, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who also inspired James a great deal, put it most simply: “You become what you think about all day long.”

>If we want to think straight at all times, we must stay grounded, look at facts, listen to other people’s perspectives, and only then draw practical conclusions.

>His most important idea is that we should question the source of our beliefs, not the belief itself. Because most of our beliefs are based on our or other people’s perception.

>Thoughts should serve a useful purpose. If they don’t, they’re useless. That’s straight thinking.

>The quality of our thoughts determines the quality of our lives. And our decisions are a result of our thoughts.

>The point is that there are multiple ways to achieve your goals. Also, if everyone is doing one thing, that often means you shouldn’t.

>If you want the dots to connect in the future, you have to make sure you form dots in your brain. The only way you form dots is by learning, doing, making mistakes, reflecting, or anything you can do to feed your brain with the input it needs to give you the output you want.

>It’s better to be aware of your thoughts and decide what you will ignore, and what you will give importance to.

>Only think about things you can control. That automatically eliminates about 99% of your thoughts because there’s very little you control in life.

>That’s why I now take more time to make decisions. Instead of following my first thought, I say, “Please give me a day or two to think about it.” That’s all you need.

>Training your mind happens in stages—and before you can move on to the next phase of your learning development, you have to get through a wall.

>At the beginning of a new stage, things are easy to learn because everything is new. But the closer you get to the end of a stage, things get more difficult.

>If you don’t know what to write about—write your life story. I’m sure you’ll learn more about yourself with every paragraph you write.

>Instead of binary thinking, start thinking more abundantly. It’s not this or that in life. You can have this and that. I always thought I had to either quit my business or take a job. Also, many of my friends think you should quit your job to start a business. Who ever said these things?

> you stop doing things the way they’re done, you’ll start doing things how you get it done.

>Perfectionism is merely an excuse. In reality, we’re scared of what people think of our work.

>No one can truly feel how it is to be an entrepreneur unless they start doing it. You can read all the business books you want, and watch as many videos about entrepreneurship as you want, but they will not make you an entrepreneur. Ever. You will only end up living someone else’s life.

>When we hold on to a lot of things in the past, they form an obstacle to living in the present.
