Wow, where the heck do I start? Truly, one of the most life-changing books I have read! My family went from living paycheck to paycheck and in massive credit card debt, to now feeling in total control of our money simply by putting Scott's Serviette Strategy in to place.

I've recommended (and lent out) the book to countless friends and family members, and pretty much every person has ended up changing how they manage their finances based on some of the learnings from The Barefoot Investor.

Sure, we've still got a long way to go before we are debt free but Scott's simple approach to managing money has us on the right path, and we're back in the drivers seat. We've got this!

## My Highlights and Notes
