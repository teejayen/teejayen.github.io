Focusing on reading (50 books in 2019), learning (WatchGuard and Office 365), sharing (you're here!), and prosochÄ“ (attention, not perfection).

Living in Brisbane, Australia - [Mount Cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Cotton,_Queensland) specifically.

Spending as much time quality time as possible with my family, and being more present.

Working as a Technical Account Manager at [answers IT](https://answersit.com.au).

Always keen for coffee or tea with interesting people - so please get in touch, [tim@neilen.com.au](mailto:tim@neilen.com.au?Subject=Let's%20do%20coffee...)
