Focusing on reading ([50 books in 2019](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84711341-timothy-neilen)), learning (information security, Office 365, WatchGuard), sharing (you're here!), and prosochē (attention, not perfection).

Trying to live more in the “now” rather than dwelling on the past or getting caught up by the future, and spending quality time with my wife and two kids.

Living in Brisbane, Australia - [Mount Cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Cotton,_Queensland) specifically.

Working as a Technical Account Manager at [answers IT](https://answersit.com.au).

Always keen to meet up with interesting people - so please get in touch, [tim@neilen.com.au](mailto:tim@neilen.com.au?Subject=Let's%20catch%20up...)
